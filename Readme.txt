In order to run demo1, use command "python Code/angleDetection/demo1_Angles.py --vid_path Media/videos/vid2.m4v"
This will use the test video as an input, and will calculate the travel and work angle between the aruco marker and
will print the values to the terminal.

In order to run demo2 (Located in Code/OpticalFlow) use command "python Code/OpticalFlow/demo2_opticalflow.py"
